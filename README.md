# passman

Python Password manager:
     master -user authentication - password creation (choice between autogenerated or self created) - copy/view my credentials by name:

# Known Issues/ Future Implementations
- Just add an if statement to incoorparate both functionalities in the same file or implement class-calls. Currently you have to run each script separately to save a password for an account and to view the saved account details.
- The passwords are not encrypted. Best way to do so is to use passlib:
    Install passlib since it is not part of the standard library, do a quick:
        `pip install passlib`
        or 
        `sudo apt-get install python-passlib`
